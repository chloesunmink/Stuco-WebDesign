                    <h2>Buddy the Cat His Story by Rory Ferguson </h2>
                
                    <p class="buddy">Let me tell you a story about a cat. Buddy was not only a happy cat but he was my friend, even nearly a year on I'm nearly in tears typing this but I think everyone should know about him.

He was lovely, feisty at times but lovely all the same, we had quite a bit of trouble naming him though for example my Dad wanted to call him "Uranus" (after the Russian Counterattack at the Battle of Stalingrad), but eventually we settled for Buddy.

What a Character as well, he loved Rowan Atkinson whenever he was on telly he would sit and stare intently at the screen and occasionally put his paw up to the screen, he also loved the bagpipes and the fiddle unusual for a cat.

But suddenly on the 13 of June 2010 Buddy was hit by a car (that’s what I get for living next to a main road), I was very sad obviously, But I feel worse for the driver he was late for a meeting, stopped to help the clean up and was in tears the whole time, we became great friends later.  is surprising because certain features of HTML5 have been supported by browsers even as the release has been finalized. <a href="https://www.our-happy-cat.com/cat-stories.html" target="_blank"> (original post)</a></p>
